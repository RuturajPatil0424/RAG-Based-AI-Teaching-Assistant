## 🧠 Personalized Knowledge Ingestion & Local AI Chat

VectorMind is designed to work with **both personal data and general-purpose chat**, giving users full control over how the assistant operates.

### 📥 Personal Data to Vector Knowledge

VectorMind can ingest and convert **user-owned data** into vector embeddings, enabling **personalized, context-aware answers**.

Supported data formats:
- 🎥 **Video files** (converted to text)
- 📄 **PDF documents**
- 📝 **DOC / DOCX files**
- 📃 **TXT files**
- 🎵 **MP3 audio files**

All ingested content is:
- Processed locally
- Chunked semantically
- Converted into embeddings
- Stored in a vector database (FAISS)

This allows VectorMind to answer questions **specifically based on your own data**, not generic internet knowledge.

- Retrieves relevant context from the vector store
- Generates **grounded and personalized responses**
- Ideal for:
  - Study material
  - Notes & documentation
  - Research data
  - Internal knowledge bases

#### 🔹 2. Chat-Only Mode (Without Your Data)
- Works as a **pure local AI chatbot**
- No document ingestion required
- Directly chats with **Ollama open-source models**
